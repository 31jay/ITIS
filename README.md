# Intelligent Traffic Information System (ITIS)

An Intelligent Traffic Information System designed to improve urban mobility through real-time traffic monitoring, analysis, and decision support. The system aims to assist traffic authorities and commuters by providing actionable insights for congestion management, safety, and efficient traffic flow.

## Problem Overview

Urban traffic systems often rely on fragmented, manual, or vendor-dependent solutions that lack real-time intelligence, integration, and local adaptability. This results in congestion, delayed response to incidents, and inefficient traffic management.

## Proposed Solution

ITIS focuses on building a scalable and integrated platform that leverages data-driven intelligence to monitor traffic conditions, analyze patterns, and support informed decision-making for traffic control and planning.

## Key Objectives

- Enhance real-time traffic awareness
- Support data-driven traffic management
- Reduce congestion and response time
- Improve road safety and commuter experience

## Target Users

- Traffic police and control authorities
- Urban planners and local government bodies
- General commuters and road users
